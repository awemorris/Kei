# ws075-p013 (H4) / ws129-p009: the demonstration image for the Latitude 5330.
# Build: plan/ws075/demo/build-demo-image.sh [BUILD] [passthrough]
#
# 2026-10-02 user: "デモのイメージはCI設定をベースに変更しましょう。"  The image
# is the CI amd64 image (config/ci/config-amd64.mk: the i915, HDA, ACPI and
# AX211 drivers, the AX211/i915/RTL8822B firmware packages, the desktop, the
# applications, OpenSSH, the graphical boot with the Kei splash and
# kmsg=quiet, Noct with its GPU accelerator) with only the differences the
# demonstration needs.  plan/ws129/phase009/phase.md has the table of what
# changed against the earlier demonstration configuration and why each
# difference stays.  The passthrough VBT is chosen by build-demo-image.sh
# (I915_TEST_VBT), not here.

# display=edp keeps the machine's own LCD (the eDP panel) as the only output
# (2026-09-29: the HDMI display is set aside; display=hdmi takes the HDMI sink
# when it is connected at boot).  The CI image writes no display line.
