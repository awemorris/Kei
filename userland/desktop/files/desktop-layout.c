/*
 * The desktop's grid and its layout file (files --desktop, ws094-p004,
 * plan/ws094/design.md §4).
 *
 * The desktop is a grid of cells, counted from the top-right corner: a
 * column is a cell's distance from the right edge, a row from the top.
 * Items are placed where the user put them (the layout file), and the
 * others fill the free cells from the top-right corner down a column,
 * then the next column to the left.  The layout file is
 * $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/keiland/desktop-layout (or ~/.config/...), one line an
 * item the user placed: NAME<TAB>COLUMN<TAB>ROW.  It is written to a new
 * file beside it and renamed over it.
 *
 * The places the items are shown at are also kept by name in memory
 * (ws094-p005), and a new layout keeps them after the saved ones, so that
 * an item made or pasted takes a free cell and the others stay where they
 * were; a renamed item keeps its cell under its new name.
 *
 * An item's name is shown in one or two lines under its icon (ws094-p010):
 * a name that does not fit one line is broken into two, and one too long
 * for two keeps its start on the first line and its end -- the
 * extension with it -- on the second, after an ellipsis ("A long name
 * of" / "...the end.txt").
