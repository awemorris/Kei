/*
 * The GPU renderer (plan/ws074/design.md §8.2): a display list drawn with
 * Vulkan, one instanced quad per rectangle or glyph, into a framebuffer of
 * the caller's image (the view's target, <browser.h>).  It either submits
 * the drawing itself and waits for it (paint_gpu_draw), or records it into
 * the caller's command buffer (paint_gpu_prepare, then paint_gpu_record).
 * The offscreen image (paint_offscreen) is a device and an image of the
 * renderer's own that a drawing is read back from (the headless
 * --render-gpu mode and the tests).
 *
 * It follows the CPU reference renderer's coverage rules (paint.h), so the
 * two pictures can be compared pixel by pixel.  Glyph bitmaps are copied
 * into an atlas image the first time they are drawn.
