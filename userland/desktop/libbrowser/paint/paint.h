/*
 * Painting (plan/ws074/design.md §8): the display list made from a laid
 * out page, and the CPU reference renderer that draws it into memory.
 *
 * The display list is the one definition of what a page looks like: the
 * GPU renderer of the window and the CPU renderer of the headless mode and
 * the tests both draw it, with the same coverage rules, so that the two
 * can be compared pixel by pixel.  Positions are the layout's units (1/64
 * of a pixel) in document coordinates; the renderers subtract the scroll.
 *
 * The first pass paints normal flow: the canvas color, each block's
 * background and borders (every style drawn solid), the text of the lines
 * with its underline, and the images of <img> elements.  Rounded corners,
 * background images, opacity and shadows come later.
