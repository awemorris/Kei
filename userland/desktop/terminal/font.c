/*
 * The glyphs of terminal: a monospaced TrueType font drawn with
 * libtruetype into an atlas of cell-sized slots.
 *
 * A character is drawn into a free slot the first time the grid shows it
 * and stays there; the renderer samples the slot as the coverage between a
 * cell's background and foreground.  When the atlas is full, a new
 * character shows the replacement glyph's slot instead.
 *
 * A character the grid gives two cells (East Asian wide, or Ambiguous with
 * View > Treat Ambiguous-Width Characters as Wide, ws128-p009) is drawn
 * into two slots side by side, in a frame two cells wide: a glyph made for
 * two cells fills it, a narrower one is centred in it, and box drawing and
 * block elements are drawn twice as wide so their lines still meet the
 * next cell's.  A character the font has no glyph for (CJK) is drawn from
 * the fallback font when there is one.
