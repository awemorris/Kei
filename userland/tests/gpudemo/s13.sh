# Kei's GPU compute demonstration (WS101, the scene S13 of the demonstration's script): Noct runs the same program
# on the CPU and then on the GPU and the two times are shown side by side.  The program (mix.nct) hashes every
# element of an array of N integers (4,000,000 by default) with 32 operations each, in a loop Noct parallelizes
# by itself: with --gpu it becomes an OpenGL ES compute shader (libGLESv2 on the i915's Vulkan).  Both runs check
# their results against the same function computed on the CPU and print a checksum, which must be equal.
