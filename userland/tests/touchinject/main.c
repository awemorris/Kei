 * touchinject: drives the test touch screen of /dev/input-inject and reads
 * it back (WS079 p012).
 *
 * The injector exists only in kernels built with CONFIG_INPUT_TEST_INJECT=y,
 * and only root may open it.  Its touch screen takes frames of fingers and
 * runs them through the USB touch screen's state machine, so its evdev node
 * speaks multitouch protocol B as a USB touch screen does.
 *
 *   touchinject [SCRIPT]   replays a touch script (standard input without SCRIPT)
 *   touchinject -c         checks the injector's refusals of touch setups and frames
 *   touchinject -s         checks the Scan Time of a touch screen that has one
 *                          (ws081-p002): its refusals, and MSC_TIMESTAMP read back
 *   touchinject -d MS      waits for the test touch screen's evdev node and prints
 *                          its name, its axes and every event for MS milliseconds
 *   touchinject -t MS      the same, each event with its evdev time (seconds.micro)
 *
 * A script has one line per frame; '#' starts a comment.  A line holds one
 * command, or finger commands separated by ';', which make one frame
 * together:
 *   size W H [N] [scan]   declares the screen with fingers in 0..W and 0..H and
 *                         N fingers per report (the first command; default
 *                         32767 32767 2: three or more fingers make the split
 *                         reports of a "hybrid" USB touch screen); "scan" gives
 *                         the screen a Scan Time, which runs with the script's
 *                         own times (swipe and wait), not with the sleeps
 *   down ID X Y           finger ID touches at X, Y
 *   move ID X Y           finger ID moves to X, Y
 *   up ID                 finger ID lifts
 *   swipe DX DY STEPS MS [JITTER]
 *                         moves every touching finger by DX, DY in STEPS frames,
 *                         MS between them (a decimal: 11.111 is 90 Hz); with
 *                         JITTER each interval is changed by up to +-JITTER ms
 *                         (a fixed pseudo-random sequence, so a script repeats
 *                         itself) while the fingers move at a steady speed over
 *                         STEPS * MS, as a panel that scans unevenly sees them
 *   wait MS / hold MS     sleeps (a decimal)
 * The script's times are a schedule from the screen's declaration: each
 * frame is written as soon as its time has come, so late wakes do not add
 * up and a Scan Time stays with the real clock, as a panel's does.
 * Every finger that touches is in every frame; a finger that lifts is in its
 * last frame with its tip up.  The screen stays declared until the program
 * ends.
 *
 * Every way out says why on standard error (BUG-099): a replay ends with
 * "touchinject: done lines=N" or with the line and the reason it stopped,
 * and -c, -s, -d and -t that fail say which.
